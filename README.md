# 👋Welcome to my special page!

Hi, I am Jeroen, software / game developer with over 8 years of experience in writing code. I love creating, writing, editing, testing code. I enjoy making games and application and am not afraid to accept challenged and adapt new technologies.

I started writing code from a young age using Skript for Minecraft servers. It helped me learn a lot of the fundementals of programming. Eventually I started making websites / webservers using JS/TS and eventually picked up React & NextJS. After some time I decided I wanted to study Game Development, so I applied at the Grafisch Lyceum Utecht. Since then I worked on many different projects and managed to get an Internship at Little Chicken and worked on the awesome game Moonlight Peaks.

I like programming all sort of things, from intricate systems to complete features. I always strive for creating readable, maintainable and extendable code. I am always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages. I never say no to a challenge and consider it to be one of my greatest strengths.
